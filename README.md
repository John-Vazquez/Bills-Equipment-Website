## Things to work on

* Find and use better images. (Some images will come directly from the company) Upscaling with machine learning models may help.
* Create more of a catalog system instead of a cart system at first. Cart will be implimented later.
* Images need to be High res and larger for website to have even looking boxes on the homepage. Try upscaling models if provided photos are not sufficient.
* Create styling for about page.
* Create styling and look for the services page.
* Create styling and look for the products page.
* Create styling and look for the rental page.
* Attempt to bring the website to the top of the search results.
* Help them find and maintain a good domain name and hosting.
* Keep in mind only Scissor lifts will be rented, so there is no need to design an item list on that page only an inventory of the brands and then the types inside of that will be needed.
