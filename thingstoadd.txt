List of Items that need to be updated before launch




1. Find an use better images. (Some images will come directly from the company)

3. Create more of a catalog system instead of a cart system at first. cart will be implimented later

4.Images need to be High res and larger for website to have even looking boxes on the homepage

5. Create styling for about page

6. create styling and look for the services page

7. create styling and look for the products page

8. create styling and look for the rental page

9. Attempt to bring the website to the top of the homepage

10. help them find and maintain a good domain name and hosting

11. Keep in mind only Scissor lifts will be being rented, so there is no need to design a Item list on that page
    only an inventory of the brands and then the types inside of that will be needed.

    12. All items from the old website will be posted on the current website, as they still have all of the same products, but,
    not all of these will be available for purchase online{

        Items that can be purchased online (Using the shopping cart system) - Concrete Mixers, Curbers, and Screeds

        All other items will only be catalog items, and will be available to purchase via messaging only.
        They like the Contact us page like the one from the "Speedpack Express" website that is also listed on my github, so we
        can take inspiration from that. We can have a seperate page for regular contacting and for purchase orders.
